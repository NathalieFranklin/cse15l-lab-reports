### grep -m

With -m flag we must also pass in the number of lines to be printed within a file that match with the passed in search word for grep. Keep in mind line read and thus printed on the terminal must contain the key word. As you can see I only chose one line that means the lines your seeing are the first lines in those text files to have the word "the". This helps decluter your command line when you just want the first occurance.

### grep -v

In the case of -v flag for grep it takes the key word you want to search for and returns to you every line that doesn't contain the aformantiened key word. Don't believe I want you to scan the text below from chapter 10 and try to find any lower case "the". This help when you know what you don't want and thus can ignore it from the text.

            In addition, Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action

                protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented

                some point, asking him about Iraq.

            Responding to a presidential tasking, Clarke's office sent a memo to Rice on

                proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would

                reportedly focused his attention.
